The report is in the Latex folder. 
    The report will be added step by step. 
    Need to read more paper to find the messages fit for the Frame.

31.08.17: begin to code the first simulation. 
    Program language: Java is good for the further extension.
                C/c++ has many examples.
                Python may be easy.

        1. figure out which one is used in NC(TCP or UDP)
        2. build a socket code that can communicate between C/S
        3. build the simple frame in detail
        4. read the paper Towards Effective Intra-Flow Network Coding in Software Defined Wireless Mesh Networks
        
14.09.17
    There is a method called “Coded TCP”
20.09.17
    Already have a udp communication program that runs on the local, still try to find the way to run that on different dockers.
